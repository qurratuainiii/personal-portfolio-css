<center><h2> Everyone has their own hobby. So I am! </h2>

<center><h3> My hobby is watching Netflix. Every single day I will watch Netflix. Watching Netflix is one of the way that I can escape from my busy day. As a student, especially for final year student, it had been hectic year for me. By giving 2 hours my time for Netflix, I can reduce my stress and relieve my tension. </h3>
